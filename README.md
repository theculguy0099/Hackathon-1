The name of our system is "IIITEATS"!

After running "python3 app.py" in terminal the flask server runs which will redirect the user to the home page which includes :
=>First of all the server will take a little while to load the top 2 photo grid, having explore button ,navigating user to the counters of various things section. Above that section, there is a design layout showing some icons. Other features are clearly visible on the site. The sites ends with a footer containing quick links to other webpages.  
=> The about us page includes the brief information of the co-founders of the company i.e. us.
=> There is also a top campus food page displaying some of the most regular foods loved by the people.
=> If a user has some questions, there is a FAQ page clearly describing the whole delivery process and other commission rates and other policies.
=> Finally, there is an order page where firstly the menu is being displayed of three canteens BBC,JC and VC. Now there comes a 'place order' form which includes several fields like NAME,ADDRESS,CONTACT NUMBER, CANTEEN NAME and the form will take upto three orders max at a time since we think that this is the max order capacity a user can bring for his/her friend. SO keeping in mind the reality, we have put there some restrictions.The user also will input the quantity along with his/here order item.
=>Now, when the order is being placed , the data will be displayed in a page visible to the customer displaying the order summary and expected time.The user won't now go back and will refresh the page if he/she wishes to place another order from any respective canteens(so, one canteen at a time)
=>In our system, it is expected from the user that he's gonna press the button 'DELIVERED' which will display a message that the item is being delivered and the shopkeeper will erase it from his order's database.
=> Now there are 3 seperate html pages for the orders i.e., VC ORDERS,JC ORDERS, BBC ORDERS, each having their own IP-ADDRESSES and webpages could be expressed by writing ..../details1,..../details2,..../details3 at the address bar.
=>Some Special other javascript effects and other css templates(including libraries such as :bootstrap,JQuery,etc. and several fonts have been used and javascript effects!) have been used which is cleary visible while running the web-app on the server!
